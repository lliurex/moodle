    give credit.
  * debian/changelog: in entry moodle (2.7.2-2), refer to #736800 and give

  * debian/watch: (trying to) get it working again, with revamped moodle.org
    website.
  * debian/changelog: add even more CVE-numbers to entry 2.7.5+dfsg-1.
  * For the record, https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3630
    will not get fixed: it's not a bug: the attack can only get launched by an
    administrator, and administrators need to be trusted.  Sites that provide
    shared hosting and want to prevent the Moodle admin user from being able to
    set executable paths can also use: "$CFG->preventexecpath = true;".  See
    also Debian bug #775842 and Moodle issue MDL-41449.
  * Fix CVE-2014-4172 and CVE-2014-2054:
    - debian/rules, debian/control: don't use CAS client library as shipped with
      moodle (unchanged phpCAS 1.3.3, see upstream 
      auth/cas/CAS/moodle_readme.txt) but php-cas as shipped with Debian
      (1.3.3-1 and 1.3.1-4+deb7u1); create symlinks /u/s/m/auth/cas/CAS/CAS.php
      -> /usr/share/php/CAS.php and /u/s/m/auth/cas/CAS/CAS ->
      /usr/share/php/CAS/.  This fixes CVE-2014-4172.
    - debian/rules: remove /u/s/m/lib/phpexcel from binary package.  Remove
      lib/phpexcel/PHPExcel/Shared/OLE* from upstream sources.  This fixes both
      a license problem and a security problem: Although the PHP license is
      generally agreed to be DFSG-free, using it as a license on anything that
      isn't PHP itself makes the result non-free.  PHP OLE is licensed under the
      PHP license.  Older versions of PHP Excel, such as the one shipped with
      moodle, suffer from security problem CVE-2014-2054.  See also Debian Bug
      #718585 "RFP: php-excel".  (Closes: #746594)
    This closed Debian bug "Multiple security issues"; thanks Moritz

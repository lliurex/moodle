Moodle quickstart for Debian
----------------------------

INSTALLATION

  After installation, Moodle will not be available/exposed by default.
 
INSTALLATION WITH VIRTUAL HOST
  If you would like to use a virtual host edit file (as a root user):
  /etc/moodle/apache.vhost.conf
  
  * make sure that ServerName is correct (the host should match what
    you provided during the installation).
  * enter correct email address for ServerAdmin.

  If you would like to keep your Apache logs separate for Moodle, change:
  * ErrorLog
  * CustomLog
  to a location of your choice (i.e. ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/moodle.error.log).

  Save the file and link it to your Apache configuration:
  ln -s /etc/moodle/apache.vhost.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/moodle

  Restart Apache:
  /etc/init.d/apache restart

  Go to the Moodle URL and finish installation - follow instructions on screen.
 
VIRTUAL HOST EXAMPLE
  To configure Moodle on the URL: www.example.com. The URL should be configured
  already and point to the IP of the server.

  During the package installation request www.example.com URL:
  Please enter the URL for the Moodle site: www.example.com

  Review /etc/moodle/apache.vhost.conf - it should contain valid entries already.

  Execute as root:
  ln -s /etc/moodle/apache.vhost.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/moodle
  /etc/init.d/apache restart
  
  Go to www.example.com and finish installation.

INSTALLATION WITH ALIAS DIRECTIVE
  If you decide to use Apache Alias directive, Moodle site will be available
  for all the virtual hosts you may have.
  You can use Alias only if the URL you have selected during package installation
  has a non-empty path, e.g. www.example.com/moodle.

  Apache configuration file is located at /etc/moodle/apache.conf to enable it:
  ln -s /etc/moodle/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/moodle

  Restart Apache:
  /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

  By default Moodle installation will only be available from localhost, to make 
  it available from any IP, edit /etc/moodle/apache.conf and comment out the line:
  #allow from all
  and restart Apache.
  
UNINSTALLATION
  After uninstalling Moodle, remove any symoblic links created for Apache, e.g.:
  * /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/moodle
  * /etc/apache2/conf.d/moodle
